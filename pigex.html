            <h2>Welcome to Pig Manager – Your Smart Farming Assistant</h2> <br>

            <p>Swine farming has long been a vital part of agriculture in Northern Mindanao, significantly contributing to the region's economy. Despite its importance, many farmers face challenges in efficient management due to outdated methods and limited access to tailored digital solutions. Pig Manager addresses these issues by providing an integrated mobile platform for accurate expense tracking, health management, and seamless operations.
